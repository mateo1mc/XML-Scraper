        <h1>What Are Sitemaps?</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Sitemaps</span> are structured files that act as roadmaps for websites, guiding search engines to discover, navigate, and index content efficiently. 
            They list all the important pages, videos, or resources on a website and often include metadata, such as the last update date, update frequency, and page priority.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically provided in XML format for search engines and optionally in HTML format for users, sitemaps improve website visibility by ensuring that all critical pages are indexed properly. 
            By providing a clear and organized structure, sitemaps enhance the overall discoverability and accessibility of a websiteâ€™s content.
